# Ionicons

The premium icon font for [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/). Visit [ionicons.com](http://ionicons.com) and  check out the search feature, which has keywords identifying common icon names and styles. For example, if you search for “arrow” we call up every icon that could possibly be used as an arrow. We’ve also included each icon’s class name for easy copy/pasting when you’re developing!

We intend for this icon pack to be used with [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), but it’s by no means limited to it. Use these icons wherever you see fit, personal or commercial. They are free to use and licensed under [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).


## Getting Started

 1. Download and extract the font pack
 2. Copy the `ionicons.css` to your project
 3. Copy the `font` folder to your project
 4. Ensure the font urls within `ionicons.css` properly reference the `font` path within your project.
 5. Include a reference to the `ionicons.css` file from every webpage you need to use it.


## HTML Example

You can use [ionicons.com](http://ionicons.com) to easily find the icon you want to use. Once you've copied the desired icon's CSS classname, simply add the icon's classname to an HTML element.

    <i class="icon-home"></i>
